### Cursor PM Tutorial... in Cursor!
In the last 24 hours I've sent this to 20 PMs that I know. Such a great idea.    
Use Cursor to teach Cursor. A self-licking ice cream cone.

### PM-in-Code
I think Cursor is the future of PM. I don't know what the idea is called - I saw it called "PM-in-Code" which seems like a decent enough label.

> PMs aren't just using Cursor to write code. They are using Cursor to PM in code.
> I spoke with a PM at a Fortune 500 company who shared their setup:
> - A GitHub repository for all PMs
> - Customer call transcripts checked directly into the repo
> - Cursor agents extract insights from those transcripts and write them to a dedicated insights directory
> - PRDs are generated into a separate folder, creating a durable record of product decisions that agents can reference later
> - A robust set of Cursor Rules to guide agents through brainstorming, synthesis, and feedback workflows
> PMing in code treats product work as an evolving, inspectable system rather than a collection of docs and meetings.
> If you’ve discovered any interesting PM workflows with Cursor, I’d love to hear them!
