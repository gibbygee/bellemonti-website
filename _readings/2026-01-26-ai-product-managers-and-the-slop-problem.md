The core argument: AI PMs understand how to work with AI systems to build products, while traditional PMs are stuck in old workflows.

I. See. This. Every. Day. It's so so hard to get PMs to adopt the new tools and it's somewhat mystifying to me. PMs are universally overworked and strapped for time — you'd think they would be clamoring for this. But it is nigh onto impossible to get adoption of new tools. It's wild.

The problem isn't just adoption resistance, though. There's a deeper issue with how AI is being used, or maybe this is all of a piece.

As <a href="https://x.com/staysaasy/status/2011911516455416068?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">staysaasy put it</a>: "Folks I cannot express just how disrespectful it is to try to get someone to do you a favor by dropping an AI slop document in their inbox. How to lose friends and piss off people."

Stay safe out there folks.
