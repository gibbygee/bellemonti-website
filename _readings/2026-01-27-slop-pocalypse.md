From Andrej Karpathy, former Director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI:

> "Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in December. i.e. I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words."

Aakash Gupta always has a good insight:

> "Engineer" as a job title is splitting into two completely different professions: people who orchestrate agents and people who manually write code. The pay gap between those two is going to get very large, very fast."

Author's note:

I think they need another P in the term - because I want to pronounce it Slop (hard p) then POCalypse. Not, sloppalypse which I can barely say. Say it like Snow-pocalypse. Ok, now I'm just being picky.

### What this all means for PMs

No matter how cranky developers are about PMs, the sad fact I've seen over and over is - PMs are routinely disregarded in many software organizations because they often dont speak at a level of technical depth that Devs are comfortable with. He who owns the compiler wins, and unless you have strong strong strong executive support, PMs often chase around trying speak the language of Dev.

To me - PMs focused on the market is not a bug, it's a feature. PMs should NOT work at a heavily technical level - they should always be honing "customer understanding" skills - what is valuable, for whom, and why.

Perhaps it's an obvious statement at this point - but I think PM what is changing beneath our feet is: Devs are getting displaced, because many are ... terrible. They are not really very good programmers. 

In a world where slop was just beyond the reach of "civilians" these so-so devs have made their living creating code "by the pound." But as the engine cover comes off, and we now have these tools that can peer inside the engine compartment and do the simple things, then DEVELOPERS need to adapt. The good ones, the deep ones? They are fine. AI tooling is all just accelerative. They make great devs even greater. But the lousy ones? Where do they shift?

Well, they are shifting over to the equivalent of "techy PMs. " In this equation, the first people who are going to be displaced? Techy PMs. It's all shifting left. 

My POV is that the PMs who have made their living moving things from XLS to Jira? Going away. Everyone will need to adapt. So either you dig in, and begin to bridge that gap between "English" and "code" (like that layer of displaced Devs)... or you go somewhere else in the problem set.

Which is to say - up. If you are a PM who has made Jira tickets your life, now is the time to skill up. Change your worldview. Use your superpowers in new ways. How do you understand what customers need, and why, and how to rank, sort, filter all of this into revenue-bearing problems to solve?

It's the new frontier for PM. The good news, those tools that are disrupting dev, are also disrupting PM. There are more ways, to learn more, way faster, than ever before.

Ultimately the displaced in this shifting might be Product Marketing. Because where are market-y PMs going to go? We'll see. A post for another time.


### Copy to .md - I'm seeing this on more pages

Copy from Claude into LLM friendly text - love this. I added this to my site (this site) for "code" blocks. But not the whole page. Maybe I need to add for the whole page?

That's all for now, folks. Stay warm, stay safe.
