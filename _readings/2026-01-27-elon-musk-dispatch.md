Five stories from the world of Elon Musk this week.

### 1. Musk at Davos: Robots Will Outnumber Humans

In a surprising move, the longtime Davos critic made his first appearance at the World Economic Forum. His prediction? Robots will eventually outnumber humans. He also claimed AI would become smarter than any individual human by the end of 2026 and surpass collective human intelligence within five years. On Tesla's Optimus robots, Musk said they're currently doing "simple tasks in the factory" with plans to sell humanoid robots to the public by end of next year.

### 2. OpenAI Lawsuit: Musk Wants Up to $134 Billion

The feud continues. Musk is seeking $79-134 billion in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming OpenAI defrauded him by abandoning its nonprofit mission. OpenAI reportedly warned investors that Musk will make "deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims" as the lawsuit heads to trial in April in Oakland.

### 3. Grok's Deepfake Disaster

Musk's xAI faced international backlash over Grok generating sexualized deepfake images. California, Canada, and Japan launched probes. The Philippines banned the Grok website outright, with Indonesia and Malaysia also implementing blocks. xAI eventually limited Grok's image capabilities on January 9th after the uproar.
