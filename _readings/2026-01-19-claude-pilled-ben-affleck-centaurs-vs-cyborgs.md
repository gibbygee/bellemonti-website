## Anthropic's Claude Goes Mainstream

The WSJ just published a topical piece on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-claude-code-ai-7a46460e?st=avcLcZ&reflink=article_copyURL_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropic's Claude and the future of AI coding</a>. My favorite line from the article: 

```
They call it getting “Claude-pilled.”

Many coders spent their holiday breaks on a “Claude bender...

... The Claude zeal has spread widely this month, even to non-engineers. Many took to social media to describe the process of building their first software program without ever having learned to code...

```
It's me!

## Ben Affleck Gets AI! Who knew.

Ben Affleck super conversant on AI, who saw that coming. So much of the popular wisdom on AI sounds just uninformed to me, but not his takes. 

Speaking of which, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32642706/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rip</a> is a fun ride. Watched it last night.

Also also - as an aside - Affleck's new production company is pioneering a new shared compensation model for the "below the line" cast and crew that work on a Hollywood production. <a href="https://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/ben-affleck-company-artists-equity-netflix-the-rip-bonus-plan/91288971" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Inc. Magazine</a>:

```
Its latest film, The Rip, which premieres on Netflix on Friday, January 16, marks the first time the streaming platform has agreed to a compensation structure where the entire cast and crew—some 1,200 people—will receive a bonus if the movie performs well.

## Centaurs vs Cyborgs

My dear friend [Hema Mohan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemamohan/) at Rubrik shared something rad with me recently. What she tells her PM team regarding how to use AI: 

```
"I want you to be a cyborg, not a centaur."
```

Which means:

**Centaurs** are visibly half-human, half-horse. When you use AI, and you dont screen it, edit it, smooth it - it looks like a centaur, everyone can see the seams. They can tell which parts are you and which parts are the AI. 

**Cyborgs** look real, but they're augmented. They're smarter, faster, more capable than their their human counterparts. When you use AI like a cyborg, you're getting better at what you do. The augmentation is invisible.

Don't let people see the horse.
