excerpt: "The single best fix you can make at a software company is to ship more."

I'm coming to believe that the single best fix you can make at a software company (especially one that is not performing to expectations) is to ship more.

By this I mean if you ship once a year then ship twice a year. If you ship twice a year, ship quarterly. If you ship quarterly, ship monthly. Ship monthly? Then ship weekly. Weekly? Daily. And so forth.

Why? Put simply: the pace of shipment will drive the pace of decisions. 

More decisions mean more opportunities to know whether you made the RIGHT decision. It's much better to know the valence of your decisions immediately. Why wait.

Ship.

// post script

Fixing your ability to ship will force you to fix all the antecedents to shipping.

How you conceptualize your roadmap.

How you prioritize.

How you define.

How you test. 

How you document.

All of it. Fixing any one of those in a vacuum is super difficult. Mostly difficult because you don't have real urgency, you have theoretically urgency. Which everyone knows is BS so they don't move very fast.
