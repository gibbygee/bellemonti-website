excerpt: "PMs are the keeper of the economic flame for the company"
---

Somewhere along the way, last 10 years PMs started burrowing into the agile lifestyle - and when we did, we lost the lense of the business.

Not sure where the idea came from that PMs are little agile soldiers - diligently creating tickets and crafting delicious user stories - maybe FAANG? 

But nonetheless this has really bedded in - and its slowly killing the profession.

What ails PM these days is that many PMs don't have a perspective on the $$$ - they have lost sight of one of the biggest parts of our job - maybe THE biggest: we are the keeper of the economic flame for our company.

## The only role that is paid to do this

PM is the only role in most software organizations that is paid to materialize success... over time... by virtue of consistent, continued investment in product attributes ... that are valued by the market, and that the company can provide more uniquely and efficiently, that substitutes cannot. That's a mouthful for sure. 

Certainly everyone at the company has this as PART of this as their brief - but they all have other more pressing problems - sales sells, dev develops, HR hires and fires, and finance tracks the money. As a PM  your PRIMARY brief is "the engine." It's the one goal that if YOU do not own, is likely to go unaddressed.
