Roadmaps are a challenging concept for PMs - maybe the most challenging concept. 

Many PMs believe it is a pro-forma part of the job - a picture that the execs or customers require of them and they are not always clear on WHY or WHAT its purpose is. They just assume "we gotta do this thing," as if it was filing expense reports or something.

If you are a PM reading this and remember nothing else, remember that:

a roadmap is not a plan, a roadmap is a story 

Roadmaps exist to be statements of intention. They describe your "point of view." They are a narrative about what you, as a PM, believe is the most important thing to build, and why. And because there is a narrative, there is an opportunity to teach, and to persuade. 

This idea of narrative and persuasion is sadly lost on all but the best PMs. If you want to be a better PM, the cheat code is to use your roadmap as the place where you tell the story of your product. 

What choices are you making?

What led you to these choices? 

What are the impact of your choices?

Roadmaps are a great VISUALIZATION of this story, but that's all they are - a picture. The story needs to come from the PM, from you.
