excerpt: "The secret to building performance into a software business is faith"
---
The financial-ization of the software business has produced some fantastic wealth in the US. But it lead to a lot of sideliners getting into the software business and I don't think a lot of them really understand what it takes to build performance into a software business. 

Money is necessary, but money is not the secret. 

It's not new tech. AI. Cloud. Blockchain. IoT. Whatever. I'm with Tom Peters on this - you can innovate any industry. 

I think the secret is belief. I think it's faith.

People need to believe what they are doing will work. Whatever it is you are doing. They need to believe in one another, and the mission of the day. They need to believe. Nothing else will make much difference.

Software companies are fragile, and this is why. They are a dandelion flower that you hold in your hand. The slightest breeze will wreck it. It doesn't take much for people to lose confidence and lose faith.
